    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
      I think progressive enhancement is the best strategy in web design because it emphasizes the web content before
      anything else. It's letting have access to the content to the web developer to give their client an easy ride to
      change whenever they want without touching other features such as CSS or JavaScript. This makes the web page load
      faster than other strategies. I think itâ€™s very important in today's world that any Contin loads quickly now so
      that users are not getting bored while searching for something on the web browser. The progressive enhancement was
      called by Mr.Stephen and Mr. Finck at the SXSW interactive conference on March 11, 2003. Suppressive enhancement
      is an evolution for all the web design strategies known as Graceful Degradation.

    <h2>
      Reflection
    </h2>
    <p> For this assignment, I asked my sister Samia for feedback on my first attempt at the Dragon project. She
      told me that she liked it as it is and that if I want to work more on ut I can play with the font style and color
      theme, which I have worked on.
      I have enjoyed this class very much. This course was well organized and our instructor Mr.Thomas Wallace is very
      knowledgeable with his course material. He guided us and made sure everyone in the class was very comfortable
      before moving into any other topics. I liked the way our instructor taught us by making an engaging environment
      with students and answering every question in an informative and friendly manner. I am still not at an advanced
      level in coding html but I have learned a lot to initiate my web page. If I start over again I would try to
      make sure not to overthink about my assignment and keep meeting the deadline. I did work on some of the advice
      and modified the color theme. I would like to thank Mr.Thomas Wallace for teaching us this course.
