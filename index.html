      Reflection
    </h2>
    <p> For this assignment I have asked my sister Samia for feedback on my first attempt at the Dragon project. She
      told me that I needed to work more on the font style and color theme, which I have worked on.
      I have enjoyed this class very much. This course was well organized and our instructor Mr.Thomas Wallace is very
      knowledgeable with his course material. He had guided us and made sure everyone in the class was very comfortable
      before moving into any other topics. I liked the way our instruction taught us by making an engaging environment
      with students and answering every question in informative and friendly manners. I am still not at an advanced
      level in coding html but I have learned a lot to initiate my own web page. If I start over again I would try to
      make sure not to over think about my assignment and keep meeting the deadline. I did work on some of the advice
      and modified the color theme.
